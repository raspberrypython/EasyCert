# EasyCert

Use EasyCert to easily generate webserver certificates against a private certificate authority that is also generated by this tool.
Why would you want to use this?  This should only be used within company networks, never public facing.  You would use this to implement
your own TLS connections where you are dealing in a test environment where the security doesn't really matter.  This is more about making
sure things work across https correctly.  In other words, when you are working on anything production-level you'd want to acquire a genuine
certificate from a trusted certificate authority and probably pay for it.

## Requirements

This has been tested and run on OSX which is comes pre-installed with openssl, that is all you need.

## Installation

Simple as it takes to type the following command:

    go get github.com/raspberrypython/EasyCert

## Usage

EasyCert just requires a pre-existing certificate authority certificate and key or simply provide a certificate authority name which can be an arbitrary name but should reflect your company and a host name that the certificate/key pair will end up on.

Usage: easycert [options...]

  -cn      Certificate Authority Name (can be any name, but should reflect your company name.)
